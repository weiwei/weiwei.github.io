The purpose of the articles is that I record myself sorting things out and trying to understand stuff. They are mostly memos or notes that I serve myself. Though i&amp;rsquo;d be glad if you find it interesting, and even happier if you could point out errors and directions. Cheers.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting is silabacion. It divides Spanish words into syllables, and tries to provide as many phonetic features as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
