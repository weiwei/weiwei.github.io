The office computer is behaving weird. The LCD won&amp;rsquo;t light up during startup. I may need to get it fixed another day.
And of course, I went for the wrong direction while taking the metro home.</description></item><item><title>Journal 2022-07-04</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2022-07-04-journal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2022-07-04-journal/</guid><description>Biking has cured my back pain.

Ate some good lunch w/ family. Long afternoon naps. 20km biking with wyh in the evening. The summer evening breeze is quite enjoyable.
Things to buy:
A folding bike. So hard to choose. A phone. Probably Mi 11 in 7/4.</description></item><item><title>Journal 2022-07-01</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2022-07-01-journal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2022-07-01-journal/</guid><description>So the first half of the year consists of the lockdown, the work-from-home, and the generally slacking of because of my mental status. This should not continue. From the first day of the second half of the year, I will try to do more, like writing useless journals about what I do. This shall be the first, and this is what I did today:
Introduced my son to the Chinese version of Hikaru No Go.</description></item><item><title>Remember to update playwright scripts</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2022-playwright-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2022-playwright-docker/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a repo that uses playwright for testing. The test runs daily with Jenkins and Docker. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite stable and haven&amp;rsquo;t been updated for a good year. Yesterday I tried to update playwright to the most recent version, but after updating, CI stopped working:
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗ ║ Host system is missing a few dependencies to run browsers. ║ ║ Please install them with the following command: ║ ║ ║ ║ sudo npx playwright install-deps ║ ║ ║ ║ &amp;lt;3 Playwright Team ║ ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝ I did feel the love from Playwright team.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Reading 2021-06-06</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-06-06-weekly-reading/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-06-06-weekly-reading/</guid><description>Chinese Language If you want to read classical Chinese text printed or hand copied centuries ago:
中国古籍保护网 is a project of the National library that incorporates all the links to local libraries that have open-access scans of classical books. It&amp;rsquo;s not that open though. Some of them requires you to have an account. 汉典重光 is a project by Alibaba that aims to digitize the rare classical copies. It mainly focuses on the books that are located abroad.</description></item><item><title>Learning Rust 01</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-01/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn rust by rewriting one of my typescript libraries into rust. The purpose of the articles is that I record myself sorting things out and trying to understand stuff. They are mostly memos or notes that I serve myself. Though i&amp;rsquo;d be glad if you find it interesting, and even happier if you could point out errors and directions. Cheers.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting is silabacion. It divides Spanish words into syllables, and tries to provide as many phonetic features as possible.</description></item><item><title>Learning Rust 02</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-02/</guid><description>Today I found an implementation of is_vowel by BartMassey. It&amp;rsquo;s a much advanced implementation. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to analyze the code. Bear in mind that there is still much that I don&amp;rsquo;t know or understand.
External dependencies The Cargo.toml indicates that two external dependencies are used:
once_cell that provides cell-like types. unicode-normalization that does what the name says. What is a cell-like type? See std::cell. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;shareable mutable container&amp;rdquo;, and the rest is a blur.</description></item><item><title>24 Days of Hanzi</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2020-24-days-of-hanzi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2020-24-days-of-hanzi/</guid><description>Preface 24 Days of Hanzi for Christmas 2020, originally published in Twitter.
Day 1 #24DaysOfHanzi 咖
Have you noticed that 咖 is pronounced kā in 咖啡(kāfēi, coffee), and gā in 咖喱(gāli, curry)?
I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until yesterday, though I already knew. Human brains are funny devices.
The word 咖喱 doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound much like the English &amp;ldquo;curry&amp;rdquo;, to the point that for long I&amp;rsquo;ve had a misconception that garlic means 咖喱. Now that I know 咖喱 is the phonetic translation of the Tamil word &amp;ldquo;kari&amp;rdquo;, I feel much better.</description></item><item><title>Every Static Blog Engine 1 - Gatsby</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/every-static-blog-1-gatsby/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/every-static-blog-1-gatsby/</guid><description>Preparation I installed NodeJS 14 LTS with package managers.On Windows I installed scoop.

Install gatsby-cli Installing gatsby-cli appears to be smooth on both platforms. I saw no error on both Windows and Mac.
npm install -g gatsby-cli npm install is quite slow in China. There are Chinese NPM mirrors. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the mirrors, you can use VPN to speed things up.</description></item><item><title>Famous Chinese Go Amateurs</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/old-articles/2008-famouse-chinese-go-amateurs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/old-articles/2008-famouse-chinese-go-amateurs/</guid><description>Here are a list of famous amateur weiqi players in China.
