中国古籍保护网 is a project of the National library that incorporates all the links to local libraries that have open-access scans of classical books. It&amp;rsquo;s not that open though. Some of them requires you to have an account. 汉典重光 is a project by Alibaba that aims to digitize the rare classical copies. It mainly focuses on the books that are located abroad.</description></item><item><title>Learning Rust 01</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-01/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn rust by rewriting one of my typescript libraries into rust. The purpose of the articles is that I record myself sorting things out and trying to understand stuff. They are mostly memos or notes that I serve myself. Though i&amp;rsquo;d be glad if you find it interesting, and even happier if you could point out errors and directions. Cheers.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting is silabacion. It divides Spanish words into syllables, and tries to provide as many phonetic features as possible.</description></item><item><title>Learning Rust 02</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-02/</guid><description>Today I found an implementation of is_vowel by BartMassey. It&amp;rsquo;s a much advanced implementation. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to analyze the code. Bear in mind that there is still much that I don&amp;rsquo;t know or understand.
External dependencies The Cargo.toml indicates that two external dependencies are used:
once_cell that provides cell-like types. unicode-normalization that does what the name says. What is a cell-like type? See std::cell. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;shareable mutable container&amp;rdquo;, and the rest is a blur.</description></item><item><title>Chinese names of early jesuits</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-names-of-early-jesuits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-names-of-early-jesuits/</guid><description>Apparently twitter API only allows accessing tweets in recent 7 days.

Day 1 #24DaysOfHanzi 咖
Have you noticed that 咖 is pronounced kā in 咖啡(kāfēi, coffee), and gā in 咖喱(gāli, curry)?
I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until yesterday, though I already knew. Human brains are funny devices.
The word 咖喱 doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound much like the English &amp;ldquo;curry&amp;rdquo;, to the point that for long I&amp;rsquo;ve had a misconception that garlic means 咖喱. Now that I know 咖喱 is the phonetic translation of the Tamil word &amp;ldquo;kari&amp;rdquo;, I feel much better.</description></item><item><title>Every Static Blog Engine 1 - Gatsby</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/every-static-blog-1-gatsby/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/every-static-blog-1-gatsby/</guid><description>Preparation I installed NodeJS 14 LTS with package managers.On Windows I installed scoop.

Install gatsby-cli Installing gatsby-cli appears to be smooth on both platforms. I saw no error on both Windows and Mac.
npm install -g gatsby-cli npm install is quite slow in China. There are Chinese NPM mirrors. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the mirrors, you can use VPN to speed things up.</description></item><item><title>Famous Chinese Go Amateurs</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/old-articles/2008-famouse-chinese-go-amateurs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/old-articles/2008-famouse-chinese-go-amateurs/</guid><description>Here are a list of famous amateur weiqi players in China.
