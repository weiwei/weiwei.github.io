He once said he has played weiqi all the time when he was at school. He said he only knew how atari works, didn&rsquo;t know a single joseki, but it was really fun.</li><li>Li Yapeng, the most unwelcomed actor in China because of his lousy acting skills and bad-mannered-kinda personality. He was chosen for the 2004 weiqi propagator by CWA.</li><li>Gao Feng or someone else, Pro soccer player. I&rsquo;m not a soccer fan so I don&rsquo;t remember his name, but word has it that he often went to Weiqi pro&rsquo;s apartment to ask for 9h teaching games&mldr;.</li><li>Li Guyi, singer. Rumor has it that she is also a fan of weiqi.
