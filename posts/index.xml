The project is silabacion. It divides Spanish words into syllables, and tries to provide as many phonetic features as possible. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much about it, just lots of string manipulation and pattern matching. It should be a good exercise to rewrite it with rust, and the result could be useful for those 5 people who process Spanish words with rust, so why not?</description></item><item><title>Chinese names of early jesuits</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-names-of-early-jesuits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-names-of-early-jesuits/</guid><description>Apparently twitter API only allows accessing tweets in recent 7 days.

Day 1 #24DaysOfHanzi 咖
Have you noticed that 咖 is pronounced kā in 咖啡(kāfēi, coffee), and gā in 咖喱(gāli, curry)?
I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until yesterday, though I already knew. Human brains are funny devices.
The word 咖喱 doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound much like the English &amp;ldquo;curry&amp;rdquo;, to the point that for long I&amp;rsquo;ve had a misconception that garlic means 咖喱.
