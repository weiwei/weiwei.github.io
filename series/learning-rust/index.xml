The project is silabacion. It divides Spanish words into syllables, and tries to provide as many phonetic features as possible. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much about it, just lots of string manipulation and pattern matching. It should be a good exercise to rewrite it with rust, and the result could be useful for those 5 people who process Spanish words with rust, so why not?</description></item></channel></rss>
