The purpose of the articles is that I record myself sorting things out and trying to understand stuff. They are mostly memos or notes that I serve myself. Though i&amp;rsquo;d be glad if you find it interesting, and even happier if you could point out errors and directions. Cheers.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting is silabacion. It divides Spanish words into syllables, and tries to provide as many phonetic features as possible.</description></item><item><title>Learning Rust 02</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/2021-learning-rust-02/</guid><description>Today I found an implementation of is_vowel by BartMassey. It&amp;rsquo;s a much advanced implementation. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to analyze the code. Bear in mind that there is still much that I don&amp;rsquo;t know or understand.
External dependencies The Cargo.toml indicates that two external dependencies are used:
once_cell that provides cell-like types. unicode-normalization that does what the name says. What is a cell-like type? See std::cell. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;shareable mutable container&amp;rdquo;, and the rest is a blur.</description></item></channel></rss>
