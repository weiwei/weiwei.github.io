It generates clean and modern document sites written in markdown.
The Major Takeaway It uses semantic HTML tags for each major part of the screen.
This is so clean we can copy over to any website we want to create.
It is React In fact it is a React Single Page App with local routing. AND it is powerful. So powerful.
The only gripe I have is that like any React App, major version update can be a bit of PITA.</description></item><item><title>The Layout of Hacker News</title><link>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/every-layout/2024-03-10-hacknews/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://weiwei.github.io/posts/every-layout/2024-03-10-hacknews/</guid><description>Hacker News is probably one of the few top sites with a table layout. A call from the distant past.
The Front Page The front page is just a table inside &amp;lt;center&amp;gt; tag. The &amp;ldquo;More&amp;rdquo; button at the bottom leads to another page, which is loaded with a new HTTP request.
The main content is again a &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; inside &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;, with each of its row as a news entry.
Page style is controlled by a CSS file which is only 178 lines.</description></item></channel></rss>
