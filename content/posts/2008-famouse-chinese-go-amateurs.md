Here are a list of famous amateur weiqi players in China. Note that people stronger than 5d aren't included.

*   [Mao Zedong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong). According to an article, Mao zedong and Zhu De played weiqi in JingGang Mountains. They were using a hand drawed paper goban, didn't notice there were 20 lines until the end....
*   General [Zhu De](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_De). See above.
*   General [Chen Yi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yi_%28communist%29). He has always been carrying a small 13x13 goban with him, even when fighting on the battlefield. The CWA was founded under his help. [View his game](sgf/chenyi.sgf)
*   [Ge You](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge_You), comedy actor. He once said he has played weiqi all the time when he was at school. He said he only knew how atari works, didn't know a single joseki, but it was really fun.
*   Li Yapeng, the most unwelcomed actor in China because of his lousy acting skills and bad-mannered-kinda personality. He was chosen for the 2004 weiqi propagator by CWA.
*   Gao Feng or someone else, Pro soccer player. I'm not a soccer fan so I don't remember his name, but word has it that he often went to Weiqi pro's apartment to ask for 9h teaching games....
*   Li Guyi, singer. Rumor has it that she is also a fan of weiqi. Evidence needed.
