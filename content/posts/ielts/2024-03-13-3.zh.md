Nowadays, children watch a lot of TV and play video games. However, some think that these activities are not beneficial for a child’s mental health.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Children's mental health is an important topic, not only parents care about it, the society as a whole does as well. After all, children is the future of us human race.

I have friends who are middle school teachers. From what they told me, around 1/3 of the children have certain mental health issues, but most of them come from the heavy competition of college entrance exams, from the endless school tasks and homeworks, from the fact they can't even get a 7-hour sleep at night. They are just kids, and they don't get to play and enjoy their life. Unfortunately, situation as it is in China and in fact in most East Asian countries, there is nothing to do about it.

Recently my sister told me that her son, a middle school student, appears to be playing too much video games, so us three had a deep talk. It turned out that my nephew is just using games to release the pressure at school, and his game pals are all smart and diligent kids. Besides playing games, they even researched programming and write games together. They also get comfort and encouragement from each other during daily routines. In the end,
I suggested my sister to buy a new computer for my nephew because the one he's using for gaming is already too ancient.

And of course, children should watch TV and play video games under supervision of their guardians. With adults' help and involvement, children will get better mental health.
