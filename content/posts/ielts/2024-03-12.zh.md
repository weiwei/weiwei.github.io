总结一下写作过程：

首先，凑够250单词还是有点难的，写完后发现不足二百，扩充了一段数了一下，220多，然后又补了一段，才到260多词。

其次，中间修改的次数比较多。如果是在纸上一次成文，估计会勾划的比较难看。不过如果是机考就不怕了。

最后，电脑打字会自动检查拼写，所以没错字。考试的电脑肯定没有这个功能。当然我写的单词我还是能保证写对的，如果觉得不确定就换个表述混过去好了。

周末看了一本雅思作文辅导书，但书里边的内容都是八股文，格式死板，文采全无。我这个是故意绕过套路写的，反正自己看了挺满意。

```
Many feel that the common educational system of teachers and students in a classroom will be replaced by the year 2050.

Do you agree with this view? Give your opinion.

The traditional education system as we know it has existed since the beginning of early civilizations. From Confucius to Issac Newton, from Alexander the Great to Elon Musk, they all have studied from a traditional classroom setting. Why people from different times and cultures use the same kind of educational system? There must be a good reason.

The reason I believe is that humans are social animals. Despite that modern social norms and technologies are pushing us to another direction, we still prefer physical presence in more intimate social settings. We get more prompt feedback from teachers and peers. We get competition and help from others. We not only learn from the teacher but also from our peers. Moreover, during the collaborative experience, we also forge friendships and experiences that we'll appreciate for many years to come.

Note only us humans, all social animals learn in a classroom-like settings, except that sometimes there isn't a roof. Wolf and lion cubs learning how to hunt, Chimpanzees learning use tools -- They all did in a similar way. So social learning is most likely a human instinct.

The COVID pandemic has been an ideal field of experiment. Students across the globe are learning remotely. And the result is telling: The students' scores are dropping in all of the surveyed countries, not only that, the students' morale was also at its lowest.

Perhaps one day learning could be achieved by plugging a USB drive at the back of your head. That way classroom may eventually become unnecessary. But time flies fast. Now that 2050 is already on the horizon. I'm not counting on it.
