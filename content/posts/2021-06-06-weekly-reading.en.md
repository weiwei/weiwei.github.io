## Chinese Language

If you want to read classical Chinese text printed or hand copied centuries ago:

* [中国古籍保护网](http://www.nlc.cn/pcab/zy/szzy/) is a project of the National library that incorporates all the links to local libraries that have open-access scans of classical books. It's not that open though. Some of them requires you to have an account.
* [汉典重光](https://wenyuan.aliyun.com/home) is a project by Alibaba that aims to digitize the rare classical copies. It mainly focuses on the books that are located abroad.

## Spanish Language

Dr. Joaquim Llisterri's [homepage](http://liceu.uab.es/~joaquim/) contains some linguistic resources about Spanish (as well as Catalan). There I found some useful terminologies that doesn't exist in Wikipedia.

[Silabeador by tulengua.es](https://tulengua.es/silabas/) is a useful tool to separate Spanish words into syllables.

What's great about the Spanish language is that the syllables are 100% computable. I have an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/silabacion) that does it.

## Programming

* [Idiomatic Rust - Binary Search Extended](https://c-hirsch.de/2020-05-30-idiomatic-rust-binary-search-extended/) takes a simple algorithm to a new level.
* [HTML and CSS techniques to reduce your JavaScript](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2020/html-and-css-techniques-to-reduce-your-javascript/) makes you rethink when you trying to solve layout problems with JavaScript.

## None of the Above

[This Taobao Shop](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2aa82e8diYB2mm&id=45233286267&_u=71p2mi281fd) prints me a book of 450 pages for as little as 25 yuan.
