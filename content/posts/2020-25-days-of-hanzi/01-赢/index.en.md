<span style="font-size: 48pt">赢</span> <span style="font-size: 32pt">[yíng]</span>

## Usage

The character originally means "profit", but this meaning is now rarely used. In most cases it resides in words like 赢利(profit), 赢余(extra gain), etc. However, even these words are rare. Nowadays 盈利 and 盈余 are more frequently used, and they sound the same.

In a lot of situations it means "win". It applies if you win a sports match, or a gamble, but usually not the lottery which technically is gamble. Examples:

* 利物浦要赢(Liverpool is winning). 
* 柯洁只赢过阿法狗一局 Ke Jie won only once against AlphaGo. 
* 柯洁对阿法狗**赢面**(chance of winning)不大，最后阿法狗是**赢家**(winner)。

It could also mean "achieve, gain", usually as part of the word 赢得:

* 赢得尊重 gain respect
* 赢得掌声 gain applause
* 赢得胜利 achieve victory
* 赢得同情 gain sympathy

## Trivia

The word is freaking hard. With too many parts cramming together, you need a magnifying glass to see its parts on the screen. It's 亡 and 口 at the top, 月, 贝, and 凡 at bottom. I remembered the word by reciting 亡口月贝凡 until I was sure I got it. It didn't take long. Long live rote memory.

Folk etymology has it that the character is formed by the five keys to victory: 亡(death, loss) - vigilance, 口(mouth) - communication, 月(moon, month) - perseverance, 贝(clam shell, which was used as currency) - resourceful, and 凡(plain, ordinary) - peace of mind.

Real etymology is a blur. The character in seal script looks like 贝(clam shell) combined with some kind of animal. Some think it's a dragon, some think it's a different magical being, some think it's just a potter wasp which we call 蜾guo蠃luo. Note this time it's 亡口月**虫**凡, and the pronunciation is different.

[Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang), the first emperor of China, is called 嬴政, now it's a family name and it's 亡口月**女**凡.
