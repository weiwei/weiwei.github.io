So the first half of the year consists of the lockdown, the work-from-home, and the generally slacking of because of my mental status. This should not continue. From the first day of the second half of the year, I will try to do more, like writing useless journals about what I do. This shall be the first, and this is what I did today:

* Introduced my son to the Chinese version of Hikaru No Go. In fact I'm trying to teach him how to play Go. He's far less interested in it than for example meteoric events, but this TV drama is good fun.
* Watched one episode of The Boys. I don't quite like it.
* Failed in upgrading Webpack 4 to Webpack 5 for the work project, again. Why does it have to be so complex.
* Ate some good 馄饨 today, some exotic ingredients. Son says he liked the corn flavored ones.
* I should plan for what's going to do next.
